# C856 User Experience Design Project Final (2 Parts)
Final Project for Western Governors University class "User Experience Design"

## Task (Part 1):

You have been contacted by the local government of the small island of Taniti. Since the island’s economy relies heavily on tourism, the Tanitian government has developed a plan to increase the number of tourists who visit the island and its attractions. As part of this plan, they have hired you to design a tourism website.

The Tanitian government has conducted a survey to gather information about current tourists. Their findings from this survey are shown in the “Survey Results” supporting document. The government has also provided you with the attached “About the Island” document to better inform you about Taniti and its visitors.

Taniti’s current website has an outdated look and feel. The page navigation is unclear. All the tourist information is jumbled together on a single page, and the site lacks booking information and links to each activity or option. The site is also not compatible with mobile devices.

The Tanitian government would like you to spend no more than one month designing a new website that will increase tourism on the island of Taniti and provide a welcoming experience for prospective tourists.
  
## Requirements (Part 1):

#### A.  Create a timeline of the UX design activities that will take place during this project.
 
Note: Your timeline does not need to reflect the exact amount of time you will spend on each activity. You may use any tool to create your timeline, including word processing software, a spreadsheet, project management software, presentation software, or another tool of your choice.
 
Note: The file size limit for your timeline cannot be more than 16 MB. Files larger than 16 MB will not be accepted.
 
#### B.  Create a persona profile based on the attached “Survey Results” and “About the Island” supporting documents.
 
#### C.  Create a low-fidelity wireframe showing the suggested flow of your new design for the Tanitian website.
 
Note: You can use any tool to create the wireframe, such as graphic creation/manipulation software, presentation software, word processing software, or another tool of your choice.

#### D.  Conduct guerrilla usability testing with at least three user testers and then do the following:

1.  Summarize the qualitative feedback you received, specifying which feedback is or is not actionable and relevant to your design.

2.  Explain how you will incorporate the feedback you received to improve your design.

#### E.  Create an interactive prototype for the Tanitian website that reflects your wireframe design and incorporates the feedback you received during guerrilla testing. Your prototype must be submitted as a URL link.
 
Note: You can use any tool to create your prototype, such as webpage creation software, GUI editors, or other web development API (e.g., InVision).
 
#### F.  List five objective usability tasks you want users to test in Task 2 for your prototype.

#### G.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized and for images or graphics from another resource.
 
#### H.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

## Overall Course Competencies:

#### UX Design Processes

* The graduate establishes user experience design processes as part of solution development.

#### UX Design Tools & Techniques

* The graduate designs user-centered experiences using industry standard UX design tools and
techniques.

#### Usability Testing

* The graduate conducts usability testing for gathering actionable feedback applicable to usercentered design.

#### Data Evaluation

* The graduate evaluates qualitative and quantitative data from UX design experiments for improving the user experience.

## Evaluator Comments:

"The submission adequately explains how the actionable feedback will be implemented into the website design and how the implementation will improve the design. A list of five appropriate usability tasks is evident."
